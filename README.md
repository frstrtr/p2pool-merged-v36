# P2Pool-Dash

Decentralized pool mining software for Dash cryptocurrency.

## 🎉 Latest: Litecoin + Dogecoin Merged Mining (Testnet)

**Status:** ⚠️ **BLOCKED** - Dogecoin testnet has a critical difficulty bug

Branch: `feature/scrypt-litecoin-dogecoin`

### Key Features
- ✅ Litecoin scrypt mining with Dogecoin AuxPoW merged mining
- ✅ Multiaddress coinbase - miners specify both LTC and DOGE addresses
- ✅ Automatic address conversion (same pubkey_hash, correct network format)
- ✅ Modern P2PKH donation script (saves 42 bytes vs old P2PK)
- ✅ Node operator fees for merged mining infrastructure
- ✅ Real-time monitoring dashboard

### ⚠️ Dogecoin Testnet Bug

The official Dogecoin testnet has a critical bug that allows unlimited minimum 
difficulty blocks via timestamp manipulation ("block storm attack"). This causes:

- **~3.3 blocks/second** instead of 1 block/minute (180x faster!)
- **31+ million blocks** (should be ~5 million based on chain age)
- **All merged mining submissions go stale** before they can be accepted

**Official fix:** https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/3967

**See [DOGECOIN_TESTNET_BUG.md](DOGECOIN_TESTNET_BUG.md) for full documentation.**

**Workaround:** Use our private testnet4 with fixed difficulty rules until Dogecoin
Core releases official testnet4. See `setup_dogecoin_testnet4.sh`.

See [MERGED_MINING_DONATION.md](MERGED_MINING_DONATION.md) for technical details.

### Modern Ubuntu/Debian (24.04+)

Python 2 is no longer available. Use PyPy:

```bash
# Install PyPy
sudo snap install pypy --classic

# Install dependencies
pypy -m pip install twisted==19.10.0 pycryptodome

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/dashpay/p2pool-dash.git
cd p2pool-dash
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Build dash_hash
cd dash_hash
pypy setup.py install --user
cd ..

# Run P2Pool
pypy run_p2pool.py --net dash -a YOUR_DASH_ADDRESS
```

**See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions.**

### Ubuntu 24.04 Automated Installer

For Ubuntu 24.04 systems, we provide an automated installer script that sets up PyPy2, builds a local OpenSSL 1.1, and configures p2pool with systemd integration:

```bash
./install_p2pool_ubuntu_2404.sh
```

### Older Systems (Ubuntu 20.04 and earlier)

If Python 2.7 is still available:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python2 python2-dev python2-twisted python2-pip gcc g++
git clone https://github.com/dashpay/p2pool-dash.git
cd p2pool-dash
git submodule init && git submodule update
cd dash_hash && python2 setup.py install --user && cd ..
python2 run_p2pool.py --net dash -a YOUR_DASH_ADDRESS
```

## Mining to P2Pool

Point your miner to:
```
stratum+tcp://YOUR_IP:7903
```

Username: Your Dash address  
Password: anything

### Advanced Username Options

You can append difficulty modifiers to your Dash address:

**Pseudoshare difficulty** (for vardiff tuning):
```
YOUR_ADDRESS+DIFFICULTY
Example: XdgF55wEHBRWwbuBniNYH4GvvaoYMgL84u+4096
```

**Actual share difficulty** (fixed minimum):
```
YOUR_ADDRESS/DIFFICULTY
Example: XdgF55wEHBRWwbuBniNYH4GvvaoYMgL84u/65536
```

**Worker names** (for monitoring):
```
YOUR_ADDRESS.worker_name
Example: XdgF55wEHBRWwbuBniNYH4GvvaoYMgL84u.antminer1
```

## Configuration Modes

### Standalone Mode (Solo/Testing)
Edit `p2pool/networks/dash.py`:
```python
PERSIST = False  # No peers required
```

### Multi-Node Mode (Pool Mining)
Edit `p2pool/networks/dash.py`:
```python
PERSIST = True  # Connect to P2Pool network
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: When upgrading to the latest version with Dash Platform support:
- **Delete old sharechain data**: `data/dash/shares.*` and `data/dash/graph_db`
- Old shares are incompatible due to `_script` field changes
- All nodes in the P2Pool network must update together
- **Protection**: Incompatible shares are validated and rejected BEFORE entering sharechain
- Outdated peers receive clear upgrade instructions in logs

**For detailed configuration, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).**

## Command Line Options

```bash
pypy run_p2pool.py --help
```

Common options:
- `--net dash` - Use Dash mainnet
- `--net dash_testnet` - Use Dash testnet
- `-a ADDRESS` - Your Dash payout address
- `--dashd-rpc-port 9998` - Dash RPC port (default: 9998)
- `--dashd-address 127.0.0.1` - Dash RPC address
- `--share-rate SECONDS` - Target seconds per pseudoshare (default: 10)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

All issues and solutions are documented in **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**, including:

- ❌ `ImportError: No module named dash_hash` → Rebuild dash_hash module
- ❌ `AttributeError: ComposedWithContextualOptionalsType` → Update to latest version
- ❌ `ValueError: Block not found` → Update to commit e9b5f57+
- ❌ `ImportError: No module named bitcoin` → Update to latest version
- ❌ `ImportError: No module named OpenSSL` → Non-fatal, can ignore or see INSTALL.md
- ✅ `p2pool is not connected to any peers` → Fixed! No longer blocks work generation
- ❌ High CPU usage → Limit miner threads with `-t` flag

**See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for complete troubleshooting guide.**

## Port Forwarding

If behind NAT, forward these ports:
- **8999**: P2Pool P2P (for peer connections)
- **7903**: Stratum (for miners)

Do NOT forward port 9998 (Dash RPC - security risk)

## Web Interface & API

P2Pool provides a web interface at `http://YOUR_IP:7903/`:

### Web Pages
- `/static/index.html` - Classic status page
- `/static/dashboard.html` - Modern dashboard with graphs
- `/static/graphs.html` - Detailed statistics graphs

### API Endpoints
- `/local_stats` - Local node statistics
- `/global_stats` - Pool-wide statistics
- `/recent_blocks` - Recently found blocks with luck info
- `/current_payouts` - Current payout distribution
- `/hashrate_samples` - Hashrate sampling stats for luck calculation
- `/block_history` - Historical block data

### Luck Calculation

Block luck shows how "lucky" the pool was finding each block:
- **>100%** (green): Found faster than expected
- **75-100%** (yellow): Normal range
- **<75%** (red): Found slower than expected

Luck is calculated using: `(expected_time / actual_time) × 100%`

The pool uses three methods for hashrate estimation (in order of preference):
1. **Time-weighted average**: Uses actual hashrate samples between blocks (most precise)
2. **Simple average**: Average of hashrates at previous and current block
3. **Single hashrate**: Fallback to current pool hashrate

### Telegram Notifications

To enable Telegram block announcements:
1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Edit `data/dash/telegram_config.json`:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "bot_token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "chat_id": "YOUR_CHAT_ID"
}
```

### Connection Threat Detection

The Stratum interface includes intelligent threat detection that monitors connection patterns per IP address. The system calculates a **connection-to-worker ratio** to distinguish between:

- **Normal**: Legitimate multi-rig miners (e.g., 7 connections running 7 unique workers = 1:1 ratio)
- **Elevated**: Suspicious patterns (e.g., 10 connections but only 2 workers = 5:1 ratio)
- **High**: Likely attack or misconfiguration (e.g., 20 connections with 3 workers = 6.7:1 ratio)

#### Configuration

Thresholds are configurable per network in `p2pool/networks/*.py`:

```python
# Default values (dash.py)
CONNECTION_WORKER_ELEVATED = 4.0   # Flag if >4 connections per worker
CONNECTION_WORKER_WARNING = 6.0     # Flag as high if >6 connections per worker
```

This ensures legitimate miners running multiple machines from the same IP are not incorrectly flagged as threats, while still detecting actual connection flooding attempts.

### Persistent Block History

P2Pool stores all found blocks in `data/dash/block_history.json` for permanent record-keeping. This allows the web interface to display complete historical data including:

- Block height, hash, and timestamp
- Network difficulty and block reward
- Pool hashrate at the time of discovery
- Block status (confirmed/orphaned/pending)
- Luck calculation with time-weighted averages

#### Populating Historical Blocks

If you want to add previously mined blocks to the persistent history (e.g., after a fresh install), use the `populate_block_history.py` utility:

```bash
# Create a file with block heights (one per line)
cat > historical_blocks.txt <<EOF
2389670
2389615
2389577
EOF

# Populate block history from blockchain
pypy populate_block_history.py \
    --datadir data/dash \
    --blocks-file historical_blocks.txt \
    --dashd-rpc-username YOUR_RPC_USER \
    --dashd-rpc-password YOUR_RPC_PASS
```

Or specify blocks directly:
```bash
pypy populate_block_history.py \
    --datadir data/dash \
    --blocks 2389670,2389615,2389577 \
    --dashd-rpc-username YOUR_RPC_USER \
    --dashd-rpc-password YOUR_RPC_PASS
```

The script will query dashd to fetch block rewards, timestamps, and difficulty, then merge this data into your block history. This ensures consistent graphs and statistics even for blocks found before the current p2pool installation.
