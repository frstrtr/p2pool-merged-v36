# Quick Reference: Version Comparison

## What We Found

### ✅ Version 16.0-204-g29fc6fc = jtoomim's Proven Stable Build
- **Author**: Jonathan Toomim
- **Commit Date**: July 21, 2022 (3+ years old, heavily battle-tested)
- **Deployed Since**: 228 days continuous uptime on ml.toom.im
- **Hashrate**: 20.01 GH/s (33% of current network)

### Key Change in This Commit
```
Stratum fixes:
  ✓ Zero-pad extranonce values (fixes odd-length string bug)
  ✓ Support Avalon 1246 ASIC miner (1-byte extranonce1)
  ✓ Use null message ID for mining.notify (protocol compliance)
```

## New Cluster Comparison (16.0-203-*)

| Metric | Legacy (16.0-204) | New (16.0-203) | 
|--------|---------|---------|
| Nodes | 2 | 3 |
| Hashrate | 20.01 GH/s | 40.39 GH/s |
| Uptime | 228 days | 2 days |
| Code Age | 3+ years | Brand new |
| Status | **Proven stable** | **Unproven** |

## Critical Finding for V36 Activation

### The Power Imbalance Problem
```
Legacy (16.0-204):        20.01 GH/s (33%)  ← jtoomim's proven baseline
New Cluster (16.0-203):   40.39 GH/s (66%)  ← Unknown intentions/stability
```

### What This Means for V36
**V36 activation depends on new cluster's choice**:
- If new cluster signals **V36** → 99% vote → activation in 12-24 hours ✅
- If new cluster signals **V35** or neutral → stuck at 33% indefinitely ❌

**V36 is blocked by 66% of hashrate's code version choice.**

## Action Items

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)
1. ✅ **Query new cluster's version signaling**
   ```bash
   curl http://20.106.76.227:9327/version_signaling | jq
   curl http://20.113.157.65:9327/version_signaling | jq
   ```

2. ✅ **Confirm legacy nodes' V36 signaling**
   ```bash
   curl http://ml.toom.im:9327/version_signaling | jq
   ```

### Medium-term (This Week)
- Monitor new cluster stability (watch for revert or crashes)
- Track V36 voting % changes
- Plan bootstrap address updates once new cluster stabilizes

### Long-term (This Month)
- Update BOOTSTRAP_ADDRS to include stable new nodes
- Archive dead/obsolete nodes (77.0.0-* versions)
- Document final network topology

## V36 Status Summary

| Question | Answer | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Is 16.0-204 on legacy backbone? | ✅ YES | ml.toom.im, 15.218.180.55 |
| Is it production-ready? | ✅ YES (228d uptime) | Network observation |
| Does it support Dash merge-mining? | ❓ UNKNOWN | Need code review |
| Does it signal V36? | ❓ UNKNOWN | Need `/version_signaling` query |
| Are new cluster nodes stable? | ⚠️ TOO EARLY (2 days) | Network observation |
